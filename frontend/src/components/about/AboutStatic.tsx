				Full disclosure: I&apos;m a <em>yak shaver.</em> It means I sometimes start on one task and find myself three layers deep
				fixing something else entirely, but it&apos;s because I&apos;m obsessed with not only delivering a great user experience,
				but also delivering a great developer experience along the way.

				Away from the keyboard, I&apos;m usually spending time with my family (read: wife and animals) , playing video games
