   - Frontend: VITE_FIREBASE_* variables
   - Backend: FIREBASE_* variables

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Frontend (.env)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=

# Backend (.env)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=
```

## üéØ Current Status

The core comments system is fully implemented and ready for testing. The basic functionality includes:
- User authentication via GitHub SSO
- Creating, reading, updating, and deleting comments
